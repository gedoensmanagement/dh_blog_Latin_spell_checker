# Building a Latin spell checker
This repository provides example code for my blog article "Uncovering censorship in the 16th century with Transkribus and Python. Episode IV: Detecting OCR transcription errors." (TODO: add link!)

* `build_symspell_dictionary` is a Jupyter notebook explaining how to generate a frequency list from a huge corpus of Latin text and use this list with [SymSpellPy](https://github.com/mammothb/symspellpy).
* `flask_rudimentary` is a rudimentary Flask app to demonstrate the basic principle.
* `flask_simple` is a slightly more complex Flask app demonstrating the [`Jinja` templating engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). 
* At the end of the blog article, I explain my Transkribus spell checker app. (TODO: add link!)
